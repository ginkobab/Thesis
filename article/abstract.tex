\section{Abstract}

Brain simulations are often used in neuroscience to test theoretical models of computation. Understanding the low-level dynamics of the brain is fundamental to develop better artificial intelligence algorithms, and in turn those algorithms provide more sophisticate methods to crack the brain code. 
Still, building simulations of sections of the brain is complex, and finding the parameters of the neurons and synapses so that the behavior of the artificial network matches the biological one requires a lot of time and resources.
Here it is developed a simple framework to automate the search for the best parameters for the simulation, and is provided a use case with a model of a hypercolumn and a Reinforcement Learning algorithm to optimize the parameters so that the firing rates match of the excitatory populations in every layer match the activity recorded in vivo.
The results show that Reinforcement Learning obtains results that exceed in accuracy the referenced papers.
